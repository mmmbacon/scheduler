# Interview Scheduler

This interview scheduler was created during my enrollment in the Lighthouse Labs Web Development bootcamp. The app uses Webpack, React, Postgres, Axios and Express to deliver a single page application. The application is a simple student interview scheduler. Components were developed in isolation using a Storybook Visual Testbed. Integration testing was completed with Jest, while end-to-end testing was managed with Cypress. The database is deployed with Heroku, and Continuous Integration is managed with CircleCI and Netlify. 

This project should help highlight my knowledge and practical application of all of the above mentioned technologies.
